AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

* Retailers

* Direct

* Distributors

Recently the company has faced a unforeseen loss by opening store in America based on the surveys, intuition and some excel analysis and also the companyâ€™s competitors has handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry.

Key Achievements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Customized Dashboard: Developed a multi-functional Power BI dashboard to specifically meet AtliQ Hardware's needs, allowing them to gain insights into their various departments.

    2. Data Integration: Data was sourced from disparate locations, including Excel/CSV files and a MySQL database, and seamlessly integrated into Power BI for comprehensive analysis.

    3. Data Model and Visualizations: A robust data model was developed within Power BI, enabling the creation of visually appealing and interactive visualizations to represent key performance indicators (KPIs).

    4. Performance Optimization: The dashboard's performance was significantly improved using DAX Studio, resulting in a 5% increase in report efficiency.

    5. Data-Driven Decisions: AtliQ Hardware can now analyze trends across different departments, empowering them to make data-driven decisions.



Data Sources
---------------------------------------------------------

The dashboard gathers data from two primary sources:

    1. Excel/CSV Files: Targets and Market Share data and related information are sourced from Excel and CSV files.

    2. MySQL Database: Facts and Dimension for all departments are retrieved from a MySQL database.



Performance Optimization
-------------------------------------------------------------

I have optimized the dashboard's performance using DAX Studio, resulting in a 5% increase in report efficiency. This optimization ensures a seamless experience while exploring the data and visualizations.
